> 时光如水，总是无言。人间安好，便是晴天。凡是努力，不必苛求。凡事尽心，随缘即可。平凡日子，顺心就好。知心三五，不理七八。自己心脏，常养常护。前途路远，不必心急。
>
> Time is like water, always speechless. When the world is well, it is sunny. All efforts need not be demanding. Everything with heart, with destiny can be. Ordinary day, just go well. A close heart, but not the other way around. Take care of your own heart. The road ahead is long, there is no need to rush.
